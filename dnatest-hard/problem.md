##DNA Test

You're DNA contains all the information needed to build another you. But we can also encode messages.

Let's see if you can figure it out. This is a hard problem, after all. 
 


#INPUT
Each input will contain a double helix representation of a DNA strand. 
One side of the DNA will contain capital letters A,T,G, and C representing the nucleotides, while the other side will have lowercase letters. Nucleotide sequences will be connected with the - characters. Space characters are included for display, but can be ignored. 

The TAG sequence can be on either side of the helix, and can be read forwards or backwards. 

#The Output
Print out the message encoded in the DNA strand.
